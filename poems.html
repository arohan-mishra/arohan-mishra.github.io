    <h1>Mother’s day</h1>
    <p>a story eighteen years and four months old<br>
    when i felt the warmth of your embrace in the bitter cold<br>
    i was one of the very lucky few<br>
    to have a great mother like you<br></p>

    <p>
    you did so many things for me<br>
    that i couldn’t even see<br>
    you cooked and cleaned <br>
    worked day and night like a machine<br>
    so much and you never ever shunned<br>
    even when i pooped when i was one<br></p>

    <p>
    for all the things you did<br>
    that no other parent does for their kid<br>
    i can never repay but can say<br>
    i love you mom and a happy mother’s day!<br>
    </p>


        <h1>father’s day</h1>
        <p>
        Who is a father? <br>
        To a family what a pillar is to a mansion <br>
        Supporting our each and every action <br>
        A person who is always loving and kind<br>
        He always knows what we have in our minds<br></p>
    
        <p>
        Who is a father?    <br>
        A person who does all the hard work<br>
        Still sits away and let his family have the perks<br>
        Sometimes what he does is misunderstood<br>
        But in the end, it always lifts our livelihood<br></p>

        <p>        
        Who is a father? <br>
        A person who is always with you when you fall<br>
        Who helps you to stand again true and tall<br>
        For your every failure he hides his pain<br>
        But when you succeed, he is the first to open the champagne <br></p>
        
        <p>
        Who is my father? <br>
        All of the above and an excellent pilot <br>
        Hearty and always ready to empty his wallet <br>
        To see us smile because of his big heart<br>
        All that he does, his love plays a big part <br>
        Such a person is my father! <br></p>

        Happy father’s day!!!<br>
